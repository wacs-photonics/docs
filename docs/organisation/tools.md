# Essential tools

We use several sharing tools for **internal communication**, **data management**, **coding** and **writing** and . Make sure you visited the [Get started](../get-started.md) page and got all the necessary access.

## Discord server for communication
We use the *WaCS Photonics* Discord server for communication inside the team. Visit the `#start-here` channel to know more about this server and to get set up.

## Framagenda for a shared calendar
* We use a shared calendar called FEMTOLUX (ask Matthieu to add you). Please enter your laser slots and any periods you’ll be absent.
* You can also subscribe (read only) to the [INPHYNI events calendar](https://inphyni.univ-cotedazur.eu/about-inphyni/events) 

!!! note "Desktop calendar app"
    To edit your Framagenda calendars from your desktop calendar application, simply add your Framagenda account to the desktop client. Once added, all of your Framagenda calendars will sync automatically. For additional details on using iCal (Apple Calendar), see the [linked information](https://docs.framasoft.org/fr/agenda/Synchronisation/ical.html).

## Zoom for regular meetings
We use Zoom for regular meetings (use your UniCA account). The links to the different rooms are pinned in the `#announcements` Discrod channel.

## NAS for raw data and processed results
* We use two different local network-attached storage (NAS) servers called **FEMTO** and **MESO** to share raw data and precessed results.
* Ask Matthieu to create you an account and follow the [data management guidelines](../organisation/data.md).

## sDrive for regular file sharing 
* We use sDrive for regular file sharing (reports, presentations, figures, labbook, resources, etc.). 
* Ask Matthieu to add you to our `wacs-photonics` shared folder and check first the `README.md` for instructions.

!!! note "Sync application"
    sDrive is built on Nextcloud. By installing the Nextcloud desktop client, you can configure it to access your sDrive files directly from Finder or Explorer. More info [here](https://confluence.cnrs.fr/confluence/spaces/SDRIVE/pages/77398389/Premi%C3%A8re+synchronisation) (Janus connexion required)

## Github for code sharing

General-purpose code for numerical simulations, laboratory instrumentation, utilities, and similar tools should be uploaded to our GitHub [organizattion](https://github.com/wacs-photonics). However, refrain from sharing any individual scripts that contain specific processing.

<!-- !!! warning
    Whenever you create a new repository, add it to the index (in the README.md that is displayed on the welcome page), in the relevant category, with a few words of description. -->

## Overleaf for manuscripts 

* For reports and manuscripts, use Overleaf.

!!! note "Premium access"
    Permanent members in the team have premium access that includes advanced features such as sharing and reviewing. Ask one of them to set up your project so you can take advantage of those capabilities.

## Zotero for shared bibliography

* Ask Matthieu to add you on our shared Zotero library
* Share only papers that are genuinely important or useful. Avoid proliferating categories and keep the organization simple by grouping each paper under its main topic. 
* When you add a paper, make sure the pdf is available and keep a consistent naming.
* Do not forget to post a message in the `paper-sharing` Discrod channel so your teammates are aware!
