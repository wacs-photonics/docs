# Essential tools

We use several sharing tools for **data** and **internal communication**. Make sure you visited #start-here and got all the necessary accesses.

- Discord server for communication.
- NAS for raw data and processed results.
- OneDrive for regular file sharing (reports, presentations, figures, labbook, etc.).
- Overleaf for manuscripts (ask a permanent member to create projects with premium access).
- Zotero for shared bibliography. Pin a message in #paper-sharing if you find an important paper!
- GitHub organization for codes. Post in #coding if you need any assistance!
- Framagenda for a shared calendar.
