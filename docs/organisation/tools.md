We use several sharing tools for **data** and **internal communication**. Make sure you visited the [Get started](../get-started.md) page and got all the necessary access.

- *Discord* server for communication.
- *NAS* for raw data and processed results.
- *sDrive* for regular file sharing (reports, presentations, figures, labbook, etc.).
- *Overleaf* for manuscripts (ask a permanent member to create projects with premium access if needed).
- *Zotero* for shared bibliography.
- *GitHub* organization for codes.
- *Framagenda* for a shared calendar.
- *Zoom* for regular meetings.
